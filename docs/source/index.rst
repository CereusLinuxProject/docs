Welcome to Cereus Linux official documentation!
===================================

Cereus Linux is a Void Linux based distribution that focuses in delivering a user-friendly experience and extra repositories. It currently supports three architechtures: x86_64, x86_64-musl and i686.

It uses the `Calamares <https://calamares.io/>`_ project to provide a graphical installer and a TUI installer forked from void-installer (from `void-mklive <https://github.com/void-linux/void-mklive/>`_). 

Currently, we provide 3 editions: LXQt, XFCE and Base. We plan to also provide KDE Plasma and Cinnamon editions.


Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
